Description:  
Using this data set I need to predict the whether a person will buy the product after seeing the advertisement. SVM is to find a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes. An SVM algorithm should not only place objects into categories, but have the margins between them on a graph as wide as possible.

## Work Done:  
1. EDA on independent variable(s) and dependent variable and answering a few questions as per my knowledge by using various visulizational techniques.  
2. Feature Engineering using medical domain knowledge.  
3. Data encoding with custom function for Normalization.  
4. Hyperparameter tuning to find best parameters.  
5. Validation of model using AUC_ROC and Confusion Matrix.
