# SVM
This is a project done using Support Vector Machines Algorithm
Desription:
A support vector machine is a supervised learning algorithm that sorts data into two categories. It is trained with a series of data already classified into two categories, building the model as it is initially trained. The task of an SVM algorithm is to determine which category a new data point belongs in. This makes SVM a kind of non-binary linear classifier.

An SVM algorithm should not only place objects into categories, but have the margins between them on a graph as wide as possible.

Some applications of SVM include:

Text and hypertext classification
Image classification
Recognizing handwritten characters
Biological sciences, including protein classification

**Work Done**
1. EDA on independent variable(s) and dependent variable and answering a few questions as per my knowledge by using various visulizational techniques.
2. Feature Engineering using medical domain knowledge.
3. Data encoding with custom function for Normalization.
4. Hyperparameter tuning to find best parameters.
5. Validation of model using AUC_ROC and Confusion Matrix.
